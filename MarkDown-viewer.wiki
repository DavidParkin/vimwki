# Markdown Viewer

## Best option is to write new module

Done as markdown-it-vimwiki\

Currently handles `[[link]] and [[link|test]]`  


JS now ts=2, eslintrc expects tabs and SuperRetab installed as pack plugin see
	  [[Neovim]]
## TODO
- [X] Doesn't work with spaces in link  
		  Gets `[[Markdown Viewer]]` etc  
		  Suspect match yes, still a problem with generated links  
		  Actually plugin still passing inline code to regex added test above. Block code not affected.
		  and probaby with urls
- [ ] Default encoding is Western instead of unicode problem with lack of html header?  
			Needs meta adding to extension see content.js
			Still a problem with Firefox
- [X] Shortens first line loses words after link and before link
		- [X] Text not caught in regex  
			How should this be returned?
			Pass after link <link_open><text><link_close><text> âœ“
		- [X] First text not caught in regex
- [X] Need to pass suffix .wiki/.md/.html(?) as an option
- [o] Tests need to be done
	- [X] Basic tests
	- [ ] fixtures - needs work on spaces and /
	- [X] Need test for suffix option
- [ ] Coveralls needs investigating
- [o] Ditto coffee
    - [X] js2coffee seems to work
	- [ ] role of coffee in package.json scripts
- [ ] unifont (unrelated) - made tux appear in Airline

## Problems with test
```js
node test.js                       
/home/David/Github/markdown-it-vimwiki/index.js:96
	md.core.ruler.push('vimwiki', vimwikiReplace(md, options));
	  ^

TypeError: Cannot read property 'core' of undefined
    at module.exports (/home/David/Github/markdown-it-vimwiki/index.js:96:4)
```
This was due to having  ```var plugin('./index.js')```placed and therefore executed before md was defined


## Regex out of date
	pattern = /\[{2}(\w+)((\|)(\w+))?\]{2}/i;
	pattern = /\[\[([A-Za-z1-9 ]+)?\|?(\w+)?/; Still unable to define space


## Installing local node

    Clone the repo

     git clone https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite.git

    And install it globally with:

     npm install -g ./meteorite

Tip:

One can also install in the same manner the repo to a local npm project with:

     npm install ../meteorite

And also one can create a link to the repo, in case a patch in development is needed:

     npm link ../meteorite
